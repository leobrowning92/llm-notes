## Overview

This is meant to encompass my thoughts about zettels, specifically the short soundbytes and thoughts that I would use to talk to someone about it for the first time.

It is not [[General Zettelkasten Principles]], but rather high level salient points to my way of thinking.

It is a 2nd brain it mirrors the associative and relational way that our brain thinks about ideas and links concepts.


### History

I thought it was developed by:
> [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann "Niklas Luhmann") (1927–1998). Luhmann built up a zettelkasten of some 90,000 index cards for his research, and credited it for enabling his extraordinarily prolific writing (including over 70 books and 400 scholarly articles).[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten#cite_note-5) He linked the cards together by assigning each a unique index number based on a branching hierarchy.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten#cite_note-6) These index cards were digitized and made available online in 2019.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten#cite_note-7) Luhmann described the zettelkasten as part of his research into [systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory "Systems theory") in the essay "Kommunikation mit Zettelkästen".[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten#cite_note-8)

But there are records of people doing similar practices from as early as the 1500s.

Modern centers of excellence and resources are [[Evergreen Notes]], and the [[Zettelkasten site and forums]]
