[[Mechanics allow meaningful agency in RPGs]] 

in DnD this is often a tradeoff between a desirable action, like a special ability or a spell, and some limited usage, or some action in a limited time frame before the world moves on such as the combat action economy. In [[OSR]] items and equipment, especially those relating to money and light often also provide some meaningful tradeoffs.

In DnD spellcasting is primarily a tradeoff between how often you can use a spell, and their super awesome game and story changing effects. In my experience where a rigorous short-long rest cadence and CR matching is not a key focus this leads to casters feeling like there is very little tradeoff, except perhaps in the spells prepared, and it leads to lack of meaningful variation between different caster mechanics (looking at you Warlock, you been done dirty).

Although this can lead to spellcasters feeling overpowered, especially in the story-effecting abilities department, in the long run I think this leads to them feeling less satisfying as there is no meaningful tradeoff.

[[Great magics require sacrifice]] is my initial thoughts on this, and reflects my search for meaningful tradeoffs in magic, which ultimately will make spellcasters feel more satisfying to play and make them more "balanced" in games where that is of a concern.

When magic has moved into the story aspect of the game in my past games, i have sometimes found that some judicious discussion can add interesting tradeoffs to magic. For example in [[Doubt adventure with Corvus Auralian]], destroying the augury stones (a magical artefact) with a magic sword resulted in grievous injury to Corvus' right hand, and kicked off his exploration of the darker aspects of his character in order to achieve his ultimate goals. This story tradeoff was very intriguing, but was largely free form, and so was only possible through high effort individual incorporation of that into the ongoing story. Implementing tradeoffs like this into a system ensure that it is a key consideration in decision making, and reduce the onus on any one player of injecting them into play, perhaps making the tradeoffs feel more real or fair.

Id be interested if [[Georgina from mines of dowley]] and the emotional/forced aspect of her magic via gemstones falls into a similar category, where a system would have made easier, and more prevalent, the interesting impacts of the sacrifices she might have to make for her magic.
