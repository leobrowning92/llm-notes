### GAUSSIAN BELIEF PROPAGATION

Fortunately, a well-known inference algorithm exists which has these properties: Loopy Belief Propagation. Belief Progagation (BP) was invented in the 1980s, and is an algorithm for calculating the marginals of a joint distribution via local message passing between nodes in a factor graph. Factor graphs are a type of bipartite graphical model that connects variables via factors which represent independent relationships.

seems to link strongly to [[Bayesian Methods]], albeit in a pretty advanced formulation. Also uses message passing as in [[Graph neural network (GNN) Introduction]], but on something called a [[factor graph used for prababilistic inference]]
