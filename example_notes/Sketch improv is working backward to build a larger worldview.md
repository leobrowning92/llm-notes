Start with a detail and build backwards and out from that to build the scene, rather than having to preset the scene to frame the details. Links tightly to ideas about improv play in rpg.

"People think improv is moving forward. What improv really is is walking backward". It is backing up that gives you discovery. Back up to create a larger worldview.

Work back from a particular detail. In order to do that, the details need to be open ended in actual sketch improv. Because you cant say no, or overwrite things.
