# Death Moves

- tags #rpg #homebrew #rules #pluginrules 

See the death choices on p155 of [[UVG rpg - Ultra Violet Grasslands]], particularly the stacks of advantages to keep their heroic last actions rooted in the mechanics. Could even allow spending as many as needed to achieve their goals.

## Inspiration
Love the idea of harm with narrative consequences and death with narrative consequences in Legacy Life among the ruins. Could add these on to any game, and be reflective of character background, experience, or class. [This tweet](https://twitter.com/cali_keftiu/status/1239087627795496960?s=19) sparked my original thinking 

Reminiscent of Zenith Moves from [[Heart rpg]], although Zenith moves usually cause your death where these death moves are triggered by it.

## Last Gamble: 
An alternative to the more prescriptive Death moves, would be that you get some fixed bit of time after your character reaches the abstract 0HP, to die in the story. Provided you can make it fit the fiction you can attempt and succeed at some fixed number of actions after your abstract death. For example, maybe oromir reached 0hp on that first arrow, but he said, “ok, now i want to draw fire and kill some orks”, but I know im going down. Lets make it worth something.

Mechanically you can do anything you normally would, but you auto succeed. And you can only do it X number of rounds/minutes/actions.


## Death Moves
Inspired by the death moves from [[Legacy Life Among the Ruins rpg]], but adapted to a fantasy context. Kept deliberately general for now, to avoid locking into any particular rule system, and to allow for ideas to develop. The intent is to be something that would make a player's death meaningful to the story, and give them a sense of impact and agency.  



#### Last Stand
You will stay on your feet and fighting no matter the odds until your allies are safe or the danger has passed.
#### Debts Owed
Pass a sigil or message, and detail what you are owed by the person or organisation it must be delivered to.
#### Martyr
your death becomes a rallying point for those who believed in you, or the purpose of your death. What do they become inspired to do?
#### You’re coming with me: 
You strike a mortal blow at whatever or whoever killed you.
#### A life for a life
If brought to safety you can be resurrected, but at great cost. It is in the hands of those who remain to shoulder the burden of this decision.
#### A death foretold
You have always known this was your time to die. You have left a message, and prepared your gear specifically to be useful to those who survive. 
#### I die on my own terms
You escape, and die on your own terms. You leave clues to a horse and gold that you left behind in a safe and secure spot.
#### Eldritch conduit
You lose your mind, and become a conduit for raw destructive power as you lash out. You become a GM NPC which is hostile to all and whos motives are uncertain.
#### Arcane Cocoon
You collapse into a transformative state. Your mind and body will be changed when you emerge. Pick a new class which you must multiclass into. 
#### Hidden Stash
You leave behind a map to a fantastic stash. If found, (this may be a challenge in and of itself)  it hold powerful weapons, armor, and supplies.
#### Unstable Collapse
Anywhere from a minute to an hour from your death, the area is wracked by terrible energies leaving it a blasted wasteland.
#### So that others may live
Chose someone present. Detail how they can make it out alive, mundane or mysterious. They do, no matter what.
#### Unstoppable force
You manage to overcome one last obstacle, be it enemies or barriers. What collateral damage do you cause to achieve this last feat?
#### Dying breath:
As you life slips from your body, so too does a message that must be heard. Your message travelst to anyone anywhere. If it can't overcome some barrier, it waits.
#### Heed my words
Your voice rings clear as you charge someone present with a mighty quest. They become moved to achieve it, even if it takes time for them to come around.
#### Last command
You utter a single command which binds everyone present for the next 10 minutes. They will follow it immediately and to the best of their ability. 
#### Yawning void
Your death pulls all the magic from the area, leaving it a dead zone. Magic items may be permanently drained.
#### Terrible passing
As you fall your last utterances are so terrible  that all lesser foeas flea. You hold on for a short time, fueled by this fearsome display. Mighty being will be wary of you for a time.
#### Majesty in death
Your death is so inspiring is awe/respect/terror that your body, and any of your allies are left untouched at minimum. If possible they are returned to friends and or given proper burial.
#### Angelic/Demonic host
Your death pulls a pulls a powerful celestial/infernal to your location. It is significantly more powerful than you, but acts in its own interests. This usually includes striking down those it seems unworthy/everyone. What did you owe them?
#### Salt the earth
Your death causes life to forsake this place. Living creatures flea, or wither and die.
#### No time to die
Whatever your mission was. You complete it as your last action. Like bond staying to close the blast doors in [[no time to die movie]].
