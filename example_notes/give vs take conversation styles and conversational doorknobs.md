[[improv theatre as a storytelling framework]]

> Givers think that conversations unfold as a series of invitations; takers think conversations unfold as a series of declarations.

two givers will keep giving the conversation to each other, usually through questions, while two takers will keep taking the conversation from one another through statements.

they make the point that takers are not villianous, and givers virtuous. A mismatch, is tough for both sides, and conflict occurs often from both sides wanting the other to convert.

> When giver meets taker, however, giver gives, taker takes, and giver gets resentful (“Why won’t he ask me a single question?”) while taker has a lovely time (“She must really think I’m interesting!”) or gets annoyed (“My job is so boring, why does she keep asking me about it?”).

In improv, asking a question of your partner puts undue pressure on them. so for that case, or multi part discussions, takers are especially valuable. Similarly, refusing to take the spotlight in a conversation may seem generous, but in fact can burden the other person to keep the show going.


> When done well, both giving and taking create what psychologists call _[affordances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance)_: features of the environment that allow you to do something.

He uses the term doorknobs to represent graspable components of a conversation or affordances. And gives examples of strong  give and take affordances:

> Takers can present big, graspable doorknobs (“I get kinda creeped out when couples treat their dogs like babies”) or not (“Let me tell you about the plot of the movie _Must Love Dogs_…”). Good taking makes the other side want to take too (“I know! My friends asked me to be the godparent to their Schnauzer, it’s so crazy” “What?? Was there a ceremony?”). Similarly, some questions have doorknobs (“Why do you think you and your brother turned out so different?”) and some don’t (“How many of your grandparents are still living?”). But even affordance-less giving can be met with affordance-ful taking (“I have one grandma still alive, and I think a lot about all this knowledge she has––how to raise a family, how to cope with tragedy, how to make chocolate zucchini bread––and how I feel anxious about learning from her while I still can”).


These examples strongly link to the idea of a [[A Fruitful Void - rich but never exhaustive detail]] and [[Loaded Questions with details]]. it also adds some symmetry and implies [[Loaded statements with details]] which is an aspect that I haven't thought so deaply of.



Another article, that was mentioned alongside this is about [[The Church of Interruption]] and takes a much more moralist tone, by a self professed Taker/Interruptor. And instead talks about how you might think about avoiding hurting a giver.
