Specifically links the stories in [[battle for middel earth - shadow of war]] to [[improv theatre as a storytelling framework]].


They make the point that you cant have improve if one of the players dies in each encounter. They bring up that there has to be ways for the encounter to end that doesn't involve death. I should clarify that to be many ways for encounters to end that dont involve the players ceasing to exist. The main character Talion dies, but respawns in fiction. Some orks also respon. Also, running away and cheating death are still significant actions in the system.

Talions immortal nature lends itself to veangence, while the heirarchical system that the orks move through and interaction leads to falling from grace, or rags to riches.

So we have stories that can be longer, because in a game that could be just about killing orks, we have many significant events that drive that emergent story. The heirarch allows the cast of characters to grow and change, and relationships between orks makes them complex and interlocking.

These are the components that allow the stories, how do they make them any good?
- Every ork must have a strong theme or motif, which they reference visually, through their own reference, and through their mechanics. See [[How to build and use strong themes and motifes]] for how you can translate this to rpgs.
- defines identity first, and then makes everything else like mechanics, weapons, appearance, and name suit that
- Unusual events such as cheating death or being rescured by a blood brother must be rare
- Dialogue that is short, to the point, and sufficiently open ended that the player implicitly fills in the blanks. Not quite so deliberate as [[Loaded establishing Questions]] but strongly in the same vein
