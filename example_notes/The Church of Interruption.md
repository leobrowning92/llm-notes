takes a much more moralist tone than [[give vs take conversation styles and conversational doorknobs]], by a self professed Taker/Interruptor. And instead talks about how you might think about avoiding hurting a giver.


From the article:

## THE HOLY CREEDO OF THE CHURCH OF INTERRUPTION:

1.  Thou shalt interrupt when thou understandâ€™st.
2.  Thou shalt speak until I interrupt.
3.  Thou shalt use physical cues to indicate when I ought continue talking.


## DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH OF STRONG CIVILITY:

1.  Thou shalt not interrupt.
2.  Thou shalt speak briefly.
3.  Thou shalt use physical cues to indicate your understanding and desire to speak.


These are a way to look at the healthy take/take, or give/give 
dynamic.
