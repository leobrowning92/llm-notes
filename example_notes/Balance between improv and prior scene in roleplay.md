[[Sketch improv is working backward to build a larger worldview]], starting with a detail framed with open ended connection to other unknown details. In improv you take that as writ, and then continue to flesh out and build on those connections. The process of doing this backwards is that you build scene from successively widening the lens for details. A cohesive scene is thus emergent rather than prescriptive where the details would come out of a broad framing.

In an rpg things are a little bit more flexible, in that we can, and often want to, spend some more time before hand to build details. We can also change details after the fact (retcon) to better suit a new idea or narrative as we see it evolving.

I should say ideally, because if we are to attached to things that are already established, then we cant be free with where things are going. And if we are too attached to where things are going, then we might have to run roughshod over what has been established. See [[The secret of Castro negro small town devil mystery]] for a good discussion of how to strike the balance of hitting repeat themes and motifs while still being flexible. This balance between future creativity, and the richness of past narrative is a balance I think is well discussed by the idea of [[anti-cannon in the UVG]]

Seth Rogen said of what makes good improv [in this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxIfm_olRz0) that the best improve comes from thinking like a writer not an actor. Of thinking not just what would my character would say in this moment, but what would I hope a character would say to make this whole scene better and move the story forward and make it all seem more natural and round out the edges that dialogue can have sometime.
