Blog post codefying their note taking style, principles and tooling. informs much of [[My Note taking principles]].

Uses an iceberg analogy, where most note taking accounts for the 10% of structured, easily codefiable notes such as meeting or lecture notes, or notes from reading. But misses the 90% of thoughts that are the majority of our thought process.

Has a strong emphasis on the incremental nature of thought, and the nature of notes over time. My own past positive experience with note taking, and using those notes, was a chronological pen-and-paper lab notebook. a chronological view, with some labeling to spur thought, was the most effective way in which I actually used and referred back to my notes. This was acheived with a paper note taking system, which in this blog they discuss as being a low barrier way to capture the 90% of thought in their iceberg analogy.

Things like [[Zettelkasten]] and [[Evergreen Notes]] focus on relational note organisation, and IMO their emphasis on time is taking a closer look at one of the only universal, in built, relationships that we share as people taking notes.



They state the following principles for incremental note taking:
> 1.  **Captured ideas are better than missed ones.** They go on to strongly emphasise low barrier to thought capture.
> 2.  **Adding new ideas is better than updating old ones.** Preserves process, and is non-lossy.
> 3.  **Ideas that can’t be recalled are worse than useless** – effective search and recall form the soul of great notes. Regardless of how you recall information back from your notes, a great note-taking system should make it trivial to get ideas out, as well as in.
> 4.  **Time is essential to how we remember**, and should be a first-class concept in a good note-taking system.

The way that this article describe them is a good example for [[My Note taking principles]]

Of these, only the last one is not compatible with or doesn't overlap with [[General Zettelkasten Principles]] or [[Evergreen Notes]].

His primary critique of tools such as [[Obsidian]], [[Roam research]], or [[Notion]] is the lack of a first class way to look at things over time.
