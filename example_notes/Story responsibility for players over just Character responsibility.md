# Story responsibility for players over just Character responsibility
- tags: #rpg #thoughtcollection

[[Heart rpg]] callings sometimes link to story responsibility and desire that isn't related to, or is directly at odds with character desire. Beyond that, they link character advancement, which is often a meta-character desire, with these story drive events.

Less explicitly, but whatever actions or events a system rewards XP to, and this links to this meta-character desire can become an inadvertent story drive from players.

  
A more explicit story drive or responsibility from players can be linked to shared worlbuilding. The idea of [[anti-cannon in the UVG]]  was born from a desire to facilitate teambuilding. Some teambuilding can come from asking players to describe aspects of the world which their character or character choices relate to. Other teambuilding can come from moves in #pbta games, see The Sprawl or #ksbd rpg, which ask the player to describe a contact, ally, or past relation. 

  

The [[Belonging outside belonging BoB system]]s  go a step further and assign world roles to players alongside character roles. This makes explicit the responsibility of players to not only build the fiction but interject events and decide outcomes relating to their world roles.

To a lesser extent rewarding characters for actions or outcomes that don't directly benefit them in character are also a means of weaving story responsibility in with character responsibility. Failure in particular makes for good story, but is almost never in a characters interests. This lady blackbeard's rewarding failure with dice for the dice pool, or the BoB games giving tokens for weak moves, incentivises players to make interesting story decisions.

  

The resistance system in HEART takes an even softer approach where taking actions in character risks I cutting stress which o. Turn can lead to indirect fallout, a kind of failure or setback which can progress the story.

  

[[swords without master]] provides strong, but not necessarily strict, guidelines about what character and world actions can happen. These guidelines are based on their story impact, not on some fictional element, and so perhaps feel less restrictive to those who are very attached to playing in character. In the case of #swordswithoutmaster these are sometimes mechanics and sometimes [[Rituals of play]].

It is this rigid adherence to in character which at it's least constructive can be characterized by "no, my character wouldn't do that" that can impede story motivated decisions. Making clear that a players responsibility is much greater than playing their character, and can encompass directing the characters part in a story and the story at large is a primary results of many of the systems here.
