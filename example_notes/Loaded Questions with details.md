# Loaded Questions with details

- tags: #rpgs #thoughtcollection 

This is one of the key [[Rituals of play]] that I believe highlights [[Story responsibility for players over just Character responsibility]], and pulls players into the act of story telling as well as just playing their character.

As far as i see it, such a question

- Establishes something in the fiction with sharp, but open ended detail. 
- Asks a loaded question about how that fits into the fiction of _another player_
- Sets the precedent in the question, for both the question and the answer to contribute to the fiction by creating [[A Fruitful Void - rich but never exhaustive detail]]

You must be clear that in establishing something in the fiction outside of your player, you may be infringing on the GM and other players ideas. This is great, but it should be done delicately, and in such a way as to allow as much openeness and opportunities for twisting in the reply as possible.

Examples include:

- [[Loaded Questions in Combat]]
- Ask left questions in many #pbta games that revolve around building an aspect of the relationship for your fellow characters, while still giving them agency in their response. [[Loaded Questions for Character creation]]
- The [[Rituals of play]] in [[swords without master]] where the dialogue between players and GM is often in the form of such questions, and the phase of the game often dictates what can or cannot be in that question or response.
