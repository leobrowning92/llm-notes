# Preparing to Improv
- tags: #mythoughts #thoughtcollection #rpg 

Preparing to improv is prep which aims always to support play.
If it is prep for its own sake, it runs the risk of removing agency in play, regardless of how enjoyable or satisfying it may be.
Prep should produce output that adds richness, direction, or variation to play.
Richness can come from thoughtful detail, language, visuals or references that can be called upon during play.


It can also come from interconnectivity or interlocking components or details.

### Richness

Examples of richness are sharp but uncomprehensive detail.
Writing and description of sharp details in  [[Loaded Questions with details]].

Interconnectivity and relationship, an example of which is [[last ghasp town generator WELCOME TO SCENIC WHEREVERTHEFUCK]] by the [[Last Ghasp grimoire]] which could be considered as an extension of the idea of [[NPC triangles]].

Great examples of rich but uncomprehensive writing style in [[Rakehell rpg]], [Lancer rpg]] and [[Heart rpg]]

### Direction

Direction often takes the farm of an opinionated glance.
Narrowing down what something is, can provide excellent creative constraints.
core should be taken to avoid being overly prescriptive in all facets.
Pick one dimension and be clear what something is) isnt.

examples include 2 things you are and one thing you went from [[Venture rpg]], springing from the [[Belonging outside belonging BoB system]]

### Variation

Variation arises from randomness.
Thoughtful random tables, generators, or deck / dice mechanics which [[suggest an underlying cohesiveness to procedural content]]
Often they help to keep us out of a rut during play.
they reduce cognitive load in situations where creativity is required, eg making the name of an NPC off the cuff., but where it is high pressure and low payoff in the moment.
